# Copy of Tetris in JavaScript
This project is made for me to learn JavaScript aswell as a project for school.

## Technologies
[P5.js](https://p5js.org/) is used to make the game. The directory containing p5.js files should be in the same folder as the project-folder.

## Install
To run the game, start any kind of webserver and open *index.html* in a browser.
